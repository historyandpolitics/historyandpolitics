On June 17, 1972, Richard Nixon, who was the President of the United States at that time, sent out five men to break into the Watergate hotel and office complex. Their goal was to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee. Though things didn't really go according to plan. The Watergate burglers were arrested at 2:30 AM. One of whom said he used to work for the CIA.

<h3>The Cover-Up</h3>
<br>
It later came to light that Nixon was not telling the truth A few days after the break-in, for instance, he arranged to provide hundreds of thousands of dollars in “hush money” to the burglars. By that time, a growing handful of people—including Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, trial judge John J. Sirica and members of a Senate investigating committee—had begun to suspect that there was a larger scheme afoot. At the same time, some of the conspirators began to crack under the pressure of the cover-up. Some of Nixon’s aides, including White House counsel John Dean, testified before a grand jury about the president’s crimes; they also testified that Nixon had secretly taped every conversation that took place in the Oval Office. If prosecutors could get their hands on those tapes, they would have proof of the president’s guilt." -
